## Overview

Building an arcade stick to replace the HORI Real Arcade Pro 4 Kai that I got many years ago. The buttons on the HIRO stick are very spread out so my fingers get tired easily.
Here is how I build a custom arcade stick by using RP2040 microcontroller and [GP2040-CE firmware](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE). I added an OLED Display for debugging and so many extra buttons to the controller.
The page will focus on how to build a standard one and briefly cover what I did for the extra stuff.

## Steps

### Making & Print Cases

My case is mostly based on [Fightstick Case](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/3D%20Prints/Fightstick%20Case) from the OpenStickCommunity.
There are many other options online.

I modeled in Houdini but I would like to give Autodesk Fusion a try next time.

### Wiring Everything

I recommend reading [RP2040 Advanced Breakout Board](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Boards/GP2040-CE%20Official%20Boards/RP2040%20Advanced%20Breakout%20Board/RP2040%20Advanced%20Breakout%20Board%20-%20Passthrough) page first.
The pins on the microcontroller are well labeled. We just need to follow the [Button Labeling Table](https://gp2040-ce.info/usage).
The joystick orientation matters, so either find the product instructions or just plug it in, record the registered inputs, and then replug them.

### Configuring Firmware

Using the [Web-Configurator](https://gp2040-ce.info/web-configurator/) from the firemware, you can customize the controller to your preference.

Happy Fighting!

### [Optional] Extra Buttons

`GPIO26, 27, 28, 29` can be used as extra buttons, e.g. hitbox direction buttons while using the joystick.

### [Optional] OLED Display

I have a 1.3-inch OLED Display SH1106 Module. It has `GND, VCC, SDA, SCL` pins on the module.
I connected those pins to the `G, 3x3, SDA, SCL` pins next to the `EXPANSION` label.
Beware that the order of the pins between the module and the microcontroller might not be the same.
Using a wire stripper and crimping tool to make a 4-pin connecter can make the wiring looks cleaner.
