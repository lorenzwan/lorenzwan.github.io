## Overview

Building a split keyboard for work so I can move the Kinesis Advantage2 to the PC. I prefer 80%-100% keyboard but Kinesis Advantage360 Professional is too pricy.
Here is how I build a manuform split keyboard by using RP2040 microcontroller and QMK firmware.

## Steps

### Make & Print Cases

I used [Cosmos Keyboard Generator](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/beta#cf) and edit it in Houdini.
The generator is in beta when I use it. It might take some time to achieve a nice-looking shape without any intersections.

I settled down with these settings, 6 keys on the thumb cluster like the Advantage2, extra row on top for function keys, extra coloumn for the index.

I combined the microcontroller holder with the base plate to create a stronger structure.
Instead of using the wrist rest from the generator, I modeled a riser for the Purple Squishy that came with the mattress.

### Wire Everything

It took me about 10 hours in total because I’m not good at soldering, but I got better and faster at it afterward.

#### Plan Matrix and Pins

I can plan the matrix however I want within the limited pinout on the microcontroller.
A well-thought-out matrix can make my life easier when it comes to soldering and debugging.

Let's look at the pins on the board I'm using. The KB2040 is an Arduino Pro Micro-shaped Pi Pico with a Type C connector, a reset button, and a bootloader button.

I decide to use USART Full-duplex[^1] driver for the split keyboard, which requires an I<sup>2</sup>C connection [^2].
Since the TRRS connectors are next to the board, it makes sense to use the `GPIO0` and `GPIO1` for the `TX` and `RX`.

Well, we have 16 pins left. Technically, I can do a 8x8 for each side with this board, which would be 128 keys total!
That’s too many keys for a split keyboard and too many keys to solder. Based on my 3d printed case, I can fit 44 keys in a 7x7 matrix per side.

#### Bend Diodes

#### Strip Wires

### Build QMK Firmware

Hardware is done, it's time for the software.

#### Setup Environment

#### Define Keyboard

#### Define Keymap

#### Flash it

#### Add Vial QMK
