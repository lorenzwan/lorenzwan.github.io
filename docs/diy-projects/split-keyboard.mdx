## Overview

Building a split keyboard for work so I can move the Kinesis Advantage2 to the PC. I prefer 80%-100% keyboard but Kinesis Advantage360 Professional is too pricy.

## Tools

| Item | Notes |
| :- | :- |
| 3D printer | Print the cases |
| Multimeter | Test connections |
| Soldering kit |  |
| Wire stripper | Make dupont connectors |
| Crimping tool kit | Same as above |
| Jewelry Plier | Bend the diodes |
| Hot Glue | Hold stuff in place |
| Isopropyl Alcohol | >70%, undo the hot glue |

## Parts

**Bold** items are what I use for this project

| Item | QTY | Notes |
| :- | :-: | :- |
| Cases | 2 |  |
| Microcontrollers | 2 | **Adafruit KB2040**, Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040, or Arduino Pro Micro |
| Purple Squishies | 2 | Wrist rest |
| PJ-320A TRRS connector | 2 | Connect two halves |
| TRRS Cable  | 1 | **UGREEN** seems fine |
| Type C Cable | 1 | Same as above |
| Keyboard switch | 88 | **Cherry MX Silent Red** or other MX-Compatible switches |
| Keycap | 88 | **DSA profile** or any uniform profiles are recommended |
| 1N4148 Diodes | 88 | Get some extra just in case | 
| 24 Gauge Stranded Wire | - | Colored would be helpful |
| Dupont 2.54mm Connector Kit | - |  |
| M3 Flat Head Screws | 16 |  |
| M3 Heat Set Threaded Inserts | 16 |  |
| Rubber Feet | 16 |  |

## Steps

### Make & Print Cases

I used [Cosmos Keyboard Generator](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/beta#cf) and edit it in Houdini.

### Wire Everything

It took me 10 hours in total since I'm not good at soldering. I solder things better and faster after this.

#### Plan Matrix

#### Bend Diodes

#### Strip Wires

### Build QMK Firmware

Hardware is done, it's time for the software.

#### Setup Environment

#### Define Keyboard

#### Define Keymap

#### Flash it

#### Add Vial QMK
