## Overview

The painting techniques I rely on most are slapchop and dry brushing. Theyâ€™re great for quickly adding shadows and highlighting details with little effort.

## Steps

1. Airbursh Black Primer
    - Apply a solid black base coat to establish the deepest shadows on the mini
2. Mid Gray Primer Zenithal
    - Spray mid gray from a 45-degree angle to simulate general ambient lighting across the model
3. White Primer Zenithal
    - Spray white from directly above to replicate a strong overhead key light, enhancing highlights and increasing contrast against the black base
    - At this stage, the lightmap is essentially "baked in," similar to how it's done for some in-game 3D assets
4. Contrast Paint, like Army Painter Speedpaint 2.0
    - Apply thin, translucent layers of color that allow the underlying light and shadow work to remain visible
5. White Dry Brush, often mixing with contrast paint
    - Lightly brush white (or tinted white) over raised details to bring out highlights, especially after applying darker tones
6. Airbrush Satin Varnish
    - Finish by applying two coats of varnish to seal and protect the paintjob.
