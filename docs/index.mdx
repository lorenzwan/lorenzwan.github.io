## About

I'm Lorenz (not Lawrence)! By day, I’m a character rigger and technical animator/artist. Outside of work, I’m a cat dad, DIY enthusiast, rock climber, board gamer, and sim racer.

Welcome to my portfolio and documentation site.

Learning one programming language has made it easier for me to pick up others. 
When I dive into something new, documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub code, and YouTube are my go-to resources. 
I’ve also found that taking notes helps me understand concepts better and gives me something to reference later.
I started with handwritten notebooks and scattered script files, but over time, 
I realized a personal wiki-style documentation site would be much more effective—especially with search, footnotes, and syntax highlighting. So, I’m turning my portfolio into a living online notebook.
It takes time to organize everything, but I’m steadily updating the site and doing my best to keep it current.

My methods and use cases might be different from yours, or not perfect, but I hope you find something here that’s useful or at least interesting.
