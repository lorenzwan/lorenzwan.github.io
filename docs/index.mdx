## About

I'm Lorenz (not Lawrence), a character rigger, technical animator/artist at work; 
a cat dad, DIY enthusiast, rock climber, boardgamer, sim racer outside of work. 

Welcome to my portfolio and documentation.

Picking up one programming launaguge helps me picking up other programming launaguges.
Documentations, Stack Overflow, GitHub code, and YouTube are my best friends when I learn new stuff.
Making my own notes ensures I understand the concepts and allows me to look them up later.
I started with paper notebooks and script files, but I noticed having a wiki like documentation site would be nice by having the searching, footnotes, and syntax highlight.
Therefore, I'm converting my portfolio site into a documentation - a online notebook.
Organizing thoughts and steps takes time, but Iâ€™m definitely updating the site slowly and trying to the stuff up-to-date.

Although my use case and approaches might be different than you, or might not be the best.
Hope you find my notes useful or interesting!
