## About

I'm Lorenz (not Lawrence), a character rigger, technical animator/artist at work; 
a cat dad, DIY enthusiast, rock climber, boardgamer, sim racer outside of work. 

Welcome to my portfolio and documentation.

::::info

Picking up one programming launaguge helps me picking up other programming launaguges.
Documentations, Stack Overflow, GitHub code, and YouTube are my best friends when I learn new stuff.
Making my own documentation ensures I understand the concepts and allows me to look them up later.

:::note

Organizing thoughts and steps takes time, but Iâ€™m definitely updating the site slowly.
